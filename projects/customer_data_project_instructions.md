You are a marketer at a design agency based in New York City. Your agency specializes in providing innovative branding solutions to small businesses. To expand your clientele, you've been focusing on reaching out to potential leads, aiming to offer them your services.

You've recently acquired a new list of leads â€” a comprehensive dataset containing names, contact details, addresses, and other relevant informationn.

Your primary task is to sort through this dataset to identify potential leads. You will be working with a dataset of customer information. The dataset includes details such as name, email, address, phone numbers, etc. 

**Objective:** Your task is to create four separate Python scripts to process this data according to the following challenges:

## Challenge 1: Sort Data by State

## Challenge 2: Filter Customers in NY
- **Objective**: Write a script to extract only the customers located in New York (NY) state.
- **Output**: A CSV file containing only the customers from NY.

## Challenge 3: Extract Specific Fields
- **Objective**: Develop a script to extract only the first name, last name, email, and both phone numbers from the dataset.
- **Output**: A CSV file with only the specified columns.

## Challenge 4: Filter by Zipcodes
