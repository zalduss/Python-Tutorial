# Comparison Operators 

## Introduction to Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used in Python to compare values. They are fundamental in decision-making processes in a program.

## Types of Comparison Operators in Python

1. **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the value on the left is greater than the one on the right.
2. **Less than (`<`)**: Checks if the value on the left is less than the one on the right.
3. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**: Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the one on the right.
4. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**: Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the one on the right.
5. **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if the value on the left is equal to the one on the right.
6. **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if the value on the left is not equal to the one on the right.

## Examples of Comparison Operators

1. ```python
   print(4 > 5)  # False
   ```
2. ```python
   print(10 < 15)  # True
   ```````
3. ```python
   print(7 >= 7)  # True
   ```````
4. ```python
   print(8 <= 6)  # False
   ```````
5. ```python
   print(3 == 3)  # True
   ```````
6. ```python
   print(4 != 4)  # False
   ```````
7. ```python
   print(5 > 3)  # True
   ```````
8. ```python
   print(2 < 3)  # True
   ```````
9. ```python
   print(6 >= 6)  # True
   ```````
10. ```python
    print(9 <= 7)  # False
    ```````
11. ```python
    print(5 == 5)  # True
    ```````
12. ```python
    print(10 != 10)  # False
    ```````
13. ```python
    print(3 > 1)  # True
    ```````
14. ```python
    print(1 < 2)  # True
    ```````
15. ```python
    print(4 >= 4)  # True
    ```
