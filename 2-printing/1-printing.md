# Printing in Python

## Overview
Printing to the terminal is a fundamental aspect of programming in Python. It allows programmers to output data, debug information, or any other textual content directly to the console. This is incredibly useful for debugging purposes, to understand the flow of the program, and to display program outputs to the user. Essentially, it's a way for the program to communicate with the programmer or the end-user.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of printing to the console is to provide a simple and accessible way to observe the behavior of your program. It helps in:
- Debugging: Identifying and fixing issues in the code by displaying variable values and program states.
- Feedback: Showing the progress or results of code execution to the user.
- Development: Understanding how different parts of the program work during the development process.

## Exercise 1
### Instructions for the Exercise
**Objective**: Write a program in `main.py` that prints notes on Python programming to the Output console.

Your code should print all three of the following lines in the Output console:
   - `Day 1 - Python Print Function`
   - `The function is declared like this:`
   - `print('what to print')`

Remember, the `print()` function in Python is used to output text to the console. It is one of the most basic yet essential functions in Python programming, particularly useful for beginners to understand the execution flow of a program.

## Exercise 2
### Instructions for the Exercise
**Objective:** Your task is to identify and fix the errors in the provided Python code in the `debug.py` file. The code contains several syntax errors that prevent it from running correctly. Your goal is to correct these errors so that the code runs without any issues and displays the intended output.

#### Debugging Tips
1. Look for missing or extra punctuation marks like quotes or parentheses.
2. Pay attention to the indentation, as Python is very sensitive to it.
3. Check for the correct usage of string concatenation and special characters within strings.

### Expected Output (After Debugging)
Once you have fixed the code, it should output the following when run:
```
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the + sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
```
