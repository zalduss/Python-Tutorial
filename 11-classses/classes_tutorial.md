# Python Classes Tutorial for Beginners

An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.

## Introduction to Classes

Classes are a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming in Python. They allow us to create objects with specific attributes and methods, enabling code reusability and organization.

## What is a Class?
- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (known as instances) will have.

## What is an Object?
- A object is a collection and data (varibles) and methods (functions). 
- When working with classes an object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.

## Why Do We Use Classes?
- Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. They allow for creating complex data structures that contain both data and functions to operate on that data.

## What is a Constructor?
- A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. It is used for initializing the attributes of the class.

Python Class self Constructor
When working with classes, it’s important to understand that in Python, a class constructor is a special method named __init__ that gets called when you create an instance (object) of a class. This method is used to initialize the attributes of the object. Keep in mind that the self parameter in the constructor refers to the instance being created and allows you to access and set its attributes. By following these guidelines, you can create powerful and efficient classes in Python.

## Understanding the `__init__` Method
- `__init__` is a special method in Python, also known as the constructor. It's called when an instance of the class is created.
- It is used to initialize the instance's attributes and to perform any setup that the object might need.

## The Role of `self`
- `self` represents the instance of the class and is used to access the attributes and methods of the class.
- It helps in differentiating between instance attributes and local variables.

It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. Whenever you call a method of an object created from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter


When working with classes in Python, the term “self” refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. Whenever you call a method of an object created from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter. This enables you to modify the object’s properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance.

Self: Pointer to Current Object
The self is always pointing to the Current Object. When you create an instance of a class, you’re essentially creating an object with its own set of attributes and methods.


## Member Variables and `self.nums`
- Member variables are variables that are available to all methods of the class.
- `self.nums` in the provided code is a member variable that stores the value passed to `nums` when an instance of the class is created.

## What is a Member Function?
- Member functions are functions defined inside a class and are used to define the behaviors of the class.

## Purpose of Member Functions
- They are used to manipulate the instance data and to perform operations using the data of the objects.

## Why is `self` a Required Parameter?
- `self` is required in method definitions to refer to the instance of the class.
- It allows access to the instance's attributes and other methods from within the class.

## Answering Specific Questions from the Code Comments

- **`nums` Parameter**: The `nums` parameter in the `__init__` method is the value that is passed to the class at the time of object creation.
- **Calling Methods with `self`**: When calling a method like `self.get_length()`, `self` is implied and does not need to be passed explicitly.

## Additional Points on Classes

- **Creating Instances**: To create an instance of a class, simply call the class as if it were a function, passing any necessary parameters.
- **Inheritance**: Classes can inherit from other classes, allowing for code reuse and hierarchy.
- **Encapsulation**: Classes encapsulate data and operations, making it easier to maintain and modify code.
