# Numbers

In programming, numbers are a fundamental data type used in various operations and calculations. There are typically two main types of numbers used in programming:

**Integers**: Whole numbers without a fractional component.
**Floats**: Numbers that include a fractional part, commonly represented with a decimal point.

```Python
# Declaring different types of numbers
integer = 4 # An integer value
float = 4.7 # A floating-point number


# Some operations with numbers
sum = 4 + 5 # Adding two numbers
difference = 9 - 4 # Subtracting two numbers
product = 4 * 5 # Multiplying two numbers
quotient = 20 / 4 # Dividing two numbers
remainder = 11 % 5 # Moduling two numbers
```

### The Modulo Operator
- Modulo Operator (%): This operator is used to find the remainder after division of one number by another.
- Commonly used to determine if a number is even or odd.



## Challenge
**Instructions**:

Input two numbers into two seperate variables. Add these varriables and together and store the answer into the variable `sum`. Then print the sum to the terminal.
